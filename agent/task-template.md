## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies
- [ ] Firebase emulators running (`npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Existing service layer patterns in `app/src/services/`
- [ ] Canvas context and hooks in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: `Firebase emulator connection issues` → Mitigation: `Check emulator status, restart if needed`
- [ ] Blocker 2: `Real-time sync conflicts` → Mitigation: `Test with multiple browser windows, check Firestore rules`
- [ ] Blocker 3: `AI service integration` → Mitigation: `Verify OpenAI API key, test with simple commands first`

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing service layer patterns in `app/src/services/` (authService.ts, canvasService.ts, etc.)
- [ ] Follow React Context + hooks pattern in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all data
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications
- [ ] Add comments for complex logic
- [ ] Follow existing component structure in `app/src/components/`
- [ ] Use Firebase emulators for testing (not production Firebase)

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with Firebase emulators (run `npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Use multiple browser windows for multi-user testing
- [ ] Verify real-time sync with network throttling
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
