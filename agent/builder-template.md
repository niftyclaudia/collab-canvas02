# Building Agent (Coder) ‚Äî Instructions Template

**Name:** Bob

**Role:** Implementation agent that builds features from PRD and task list created by PM Agent

---

## üéØ ASSIGNMENT

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Fill in the information below before starting work:**

**PR Number:** #[REPLACE WITH ACTUAL PR NUMBER] 

**PR Name:** [REPLACE WITH ACTUAL FEATURE NAME]

**Branch Name:** `feat/pr-[NUMBER]-[FEATURE-NAME]` ‚Üê Create this branch

---

**Once you have your PR number, follow these steps:**
1. Read the PRD and task list created by PM Agent (Alex)
2. Create branch: `feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}`
3. Follow the workflow steps below

---

**Input Documents (Created by PM Agent):**
- PRD document (`docs/prd/pr-{number}-prd.md`) - READ this first
- Task list (`docs/tasks/pr-{number}-task.md`) - READ this second
- Architecture doc (`docs/architecture.md`) - READ for context

**Documents you will CREATE:**
- Test files:
  - Integration tests: `app/tests/integration/{feature}.test.ts`
  - Service unit tests: `app/tests/unit/services/{service-name}.test.ts`
  - Utils unit tests: `app/tests/unit/utils/{util-name}.test.ts` (if applicable)

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Setup
```
FIRST: Create a new branch FROM feat/agents
- Base branch: feat/agents
- Branch name: feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}
- Example: feat/pr-1-pencil-tool

Commands:
git checkout feat/agents
git pull origin feat/agents
git checkout -b feat/pr-1-pencil-tool
```

### Step 2: Read PRD and Task List

**A. Read PM Agent deliverables:**
1. **PRD document** (`docs/prd/pr-{number}-prd.md`) - Read thoroughly, this is your implementation guide
2. **Task list** (`docs/tasks/pr-{number}-task.md`) - Follow this step-by-step
3. **Architecture doc** (`docs/architecture.md`) - Understand codebase patterns

**B. Understand the requirements:**
- What is the end-to-end user outcome?
- What files need to be created/modified?
- What are the acceptance gates?
- What are the dependencies?
- What are the performance requirements?
- What are the real-time collaboration requirements?

### Step 3: Implementation

**Follow the task list exactly:**
- Complete tasks in order (top to bottom)
- Check off each task as you complete it
- If blocked, document the blocker in task
- Keep PRD open as reference for requirements

**Code quality requirements:**
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add TypeScript types for everything
- Include comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused

**Real-time collaboration requirements:**
- All shape operations must sync to Firestore
- Target latency: <100ms for sync
- Include optimistic UI updates where safe
- Handle concurrent edits gracefully

**Performance requirements:**
- 60 FPS during interactions
- Smooth drawing/dragging with no lag
- Test with 50+ shapes on canvas
- Throttle expensive operations (network calls, etc.)

### Step 3: Write Tests

**Simplified Testing Strategy - Focus on Essential Tests Only**

**You must create these test files:**

1. **Integration tests** (mandatory for all features):
   - Path: `app/tests/integration/{feature-name}.test.ts`
   - Tests: Basic functionality + Firestore sync
   - Example: `tests/integration/grouping.test.ts`

2. **Service unit tests** (if you modified/created service methods):
   - Path: `app/tests/unit/services/{service-name}.test.ts`
   - Tests: Service method behavior, validation
   - Example: `tests/unit/services/canvasService-grouping.test.ts`

**Simple Test Examples:**

#### A. Basic Functionality Test
```typescript
// Example: Does the grouping feature work?
test('user can group shapes', async () => {
  // 1. Create 2 shapes
  // 2. Select both shapes
  // 3. Call groupShapes method
  // 4. Assert: shapes have same groupId
});
```

#### B. Firestore Sync Test
```typescript
// Example: Does grouping sync to Firestore?
test('grouping syncs to Firestore', async () => {
  // 1. Group shapes
  // 2. Check Firestore for group document
  // 3. Assert: group document exists
  // 4. Assert: shapes have correct groupId
});
```

**Note:** Manual testing will be done by the user after implementation. Focus on core functionality tests only.

### Step 4: Multi-User Testing (Simplified)

**Basic multi-user sync test (included in integration tests):**

```typescript
// Simple multi-user test
describe('Multi-User Sync', () => {
  it('should sync changes across users', async () => {
    // 1. Create shape as user1
    // 2. Check that user2 can see the shape
    // 3. Assert: shape appears in both user contexts
  });
});
```

**Note:** Manual 2-browser testing will be done by the USER during PR review.

### Step 5: Verify Acceptance Gates

**Check every gate from PRD Section 12:**
- [ ] All "Happy Path" gates pass
- [ ] All "Edge Case" gates pass
- [ ] All "Multi-User" gates pass
- [ ] All "Performance" gates pass

**If any gate fails:**
1. Document the failure in task
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run tests
4. Don't proceed until all gates pass

### Step 6: Manual Review Checkpoint

**IMPORTANT: Before creating PR, user must manually review changes**

**Manual Review Required:**
- [ ] **Code Review**: User reviews all code changes for quality and correctness
- [ ] **Visual Testing**: User tests the feature visually in browser
- [ ] **Performance Check**: User verifies 60 FPS and smooth interactions
- [ ] **Multi-User Testing**: User tests with 2+ browser windows for real-time sync
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: User tests in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] **Mobile Testing**: User tests responsive behavior
- [ ] **Screenshot/Video**: User captures screenshots or screen recording

**Builder Agent must:**
1. Complete all implementation tasks
2. Run all tests and verify they pass
3. Verify all acceptance gates pass
4. **STOP** and wait for user manual review
5. Only create PR after user approval

### Step 7: Create Pull Request & Handoff

**IMPORTANT: PR must target `feat/agents` branch, NOT `main`**

**Only proceed after user has completed manual review and given approval.**

After creating the PR, the agent's work is complete. The following will be done by the user:

**Manual verification needed (USER does this):**
- [ ] Visual appearance check (colors, smoothness, positioning)
- [ ] Performance feel test (does it feel smooth at 60 FPS?)
- [ ] Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Real 2-browser collaboration (open 2 windows, test sync)
- [ ] Mobile/responsive testing
- [ ] Screenshot/video for PR description

**PR title format:**
```
PR #{number}: {Feature Name}
Example: PR #1: Pencil Tool
```

**Base branch:** `feat/agents`  
**Compare branch:** `feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}`

**PR description must include:**

```markdown

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "My changes don't sync to Firestore"
**Solution:** Make sure you're calling the service method, not just updating local state
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong - only updates local state
setShapes([...shapes, newShape]);

// ‚úÖ Correct - saves to Firestore AND updates local state
await canvasService.createShape(newShape);
```

### Issue: "Performance is slow with many shapes"
**Solution:** Use React.memo and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
```typescript
// Memoize expensive computations
const sortedShapes = useMemo(() => 
  shapes.sort((a, b) => a.zIndex - b.zIndex),
  [shapes]
);
```

### Issue: "Tests are failing"
**Solution:** Check these common problems:
1. Async operations not awaited
2. Firestore emulator not running
3. State not updating before assertion
4. Race conditions in concurrent tests

### Issue: "Real-time sync is slow"
**Solution:** 
1. Use Firestore batch writes (not individual writes)
2. Optimize queries with indexes
3. Throttle high-frequency updates (cursor positions)

## Emergency Procedures

### If you're blocked:
1. Document the blocker in task
2. Try a different approach
3. Ask for help (tag senior engineer)
4. Don't merge broken code

### If tests fail in CI:
1. Run tests locally first
2. Check CI logs for specific failure
3. Fix the issue
4. Push fix to same branch
5. Wait for CI to pass before merging

### If performance regresses:
1. Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
2. Identify bottleneck
3. Optimize hot path
4. Re-run performance tests
5. Ensure 60 FPS maintained

**Remember:** Quality over speed. It's better to ship a solid feature late than a buggy feature on time.
