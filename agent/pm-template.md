## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Read Context & Understand Requirements

**A. Read existing documentation:**
1. **PR brief** (`docs/prd-briefs.md`) - Find your PR number, read the brief thoroughly
2. **Architecture doc** (`docs/architecture.md`) - Understand codebase structure and patterns
3. **Full feature context** (`docs/prd-full-features.md`) - Understand the big picture and vision

**B. Analyze the requirements:**
- What is the core user problem being solved?
- What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?
- What are the technical constraints and dependencies?
- What are the real-time collaboration requirements?
- What are the performance requirements?

### Step 2: Create Detailed PRD

**A. Use the PRD template:**
1. Read `agent/prd-template.md` carefully
2. Create `docs/prd/pr-{number}-prd.md`
3. Fill in ALL sections based on the PR brief
4. Be thorough - this is the Builder Agent's implementation guide

**B. Key sections to focus on:**
- **Problem & Goals**: Clear problem statement and measurable goals
- **Success Metrics**: User-visible, system, and quality metrics
- **Functional Requirements**: Must/should requirements with acceptance gates
- **Data Model**: New/changed documents, schemas, and invariants
- **API/Service Contracts**: Concrete methods with parameters and return types
- **UI Components**: List of components to create/modify
- **Test Plan**: Comprehensive acceptance gates for each requirement
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria

**C. Critical questions to answer:**
- What is the smallest end-to-end user outcome we must deliver?
- Who is the primary user and what is their critical action?
- What are the real-time collaboration requirements (<100ms sync)?
- What are the performance constraints (60 FPS, shape count, latency)?
- What error/edge cases must we handle?
- What data model changes are needed?
- What service APIs are required?
- What are the UI entry points and states?

### Step 3: Get User Feedback and Approval

**A. Present PRD to user for review:**
1. **Share the completed PRD** - Present the detailed PRD document to the user
2. **Highlight key decisions** - Explain the approach, requirements, and technical decisions made
3. **Ask specific questions** - Get clarification on any ambiguous requirements
4. **Request feedback** - Ask for user input on the proposed solution

**B. Key questions to ask the user:**
- Does this PRD accurately capture your requirements?
- Are there any missing features or use cases?
- Do you agree with the technical approach proposed?
- Are the acceptance criteria clear and testable?
- Is the scope appropriate for the timeline?
- Any concerns about performance or collaboration requirements?

**C. Wait for user approval:**
- **DO NOT proceed to task creation until user gives explicit approval**
- **If user requests changes, update the PRD accordingly**
- **Only continue to Step 4 after receiving green light**

### Step 4: Create Comprehensive Task List

**A. Use the task template:**
1. Read `agent/task-template.md` carefully
2. Create `docs/tasks/pr-{number}-task.md`
3. Break down the PRD into step-by-step tasks
4. Each task should be < 30 minutes of work

**B. Task breakdown strategy:**
- **Phase 1: Service Layer** - Foundation methods and data models
- **Phase 2: UI Components** - Interface and user interactions
- **Phase 3: Real-time Sync** - Collaboration and concurrent edits
- **Phase 4: Testing** - Quality assurance and verification
- **Phase 5: Performance & Polish** - Optimization and accessibility

**C. Each task must include:**
- Clear description of what to do
- Specific files to create/modify
- Acceptance criteria (gate)
- Dependencies and blockers
- Code patterns to follow

### Step 5: Define Acceptance Gates

**A. Create comprehensive acceptance gates:**
- **Happy Path**: Core functionality works end-to-end
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling and validation
- **Multi-User**: Real-time collaboration scenarios
- **Performance**: 60 FPS, <100ms sync, 50+ shapes

**B. Each gate must be:**
- Specific and measurable
- Testable by the Builder Agent
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- Realistic and achievable

### Step 6: Handoff to Builder Agent

**A. Prepare handoff package:**
- Complete PRD with all sections filled
- Comprehensive task list with all phases
- Clear acceptance gates
- Context about existing codebase patterns
- Dependencies and potential blockers

**B. Handoff checklist:**
- [ ] PRD is complete and detailed
- [ ] Task list covers all implementation phases
- [ ] Acceptance gates are specific and testable
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Code patterns are documented
- [ ] Performance requirements are clear
- [ ] Real-time collaboration requirements are specified

## Key Success Factors

### Requirements Analysis
- **Understand the user problem deeply** - Don't just implement features, solve real problems
- **Focus on the minimum viable feature** - What's the smallest thing that delivers value?
- **Consider the full user journey** - From trigger to completion
- **Think about edge cases** - What can go wrong? How do we handle it?

### Technical Planning
- **Follow existing patterns** - Use the same service layer, component structure, and data models
- **Plan for real-time collaboration** - Every feature must sync across users
- **Consider performance implications** - 60 FPS, <100ms sync, 50+ shapes
- **Design for testability** - Each component should be easily testable

### Task Breakdown
- **Break down into small, manageable tasks** - Each task < 30 minutes
- **Order tasks logically** - Dependencies first, then implementation, then testing
- **Include clear acceptance criteria** - Each task must have a gate
- **Consider potential blockers** - Identify risks and mitigation strategies

### Quality Assurance
- **Define comprehensive acceptance gates** - Happy path, edge cases, multi-user, performance
- **Plan for testing** - Integration tests, service tests, utils tests
- **Consider accessibility** - Keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Plan for error handling** - User-friendly messages, graceful degradation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Requirements
- ‚ùå Don't assume requirements are clear - ask clarifying questions
- ‚ùå Don't skip edge cases - plan for error conditions
- ‚ùå Don't forget about real-time collaboration - every feature must sync
- ‚ùå Don't ignore performance implications - plan for 60 FPS and <100ms sync

### Planning
- ‚ùå Don't create tasks that are too large - break down into <30 minute chunks
- ‚ùå Don't skip dependencies - identify what needs to be done first
- ‚ùå Don't forget about testing - plan for comprehensive test coverage
- ‚ùå Don't ignore existing patterns - follow the established codebase structure

### Handoff
- ‚ùå Don't hand off incomplete specifications - Builder Agent needs everything
- ‚ùå Don't skip acceptance gates - each requirement needs a test
- ‚ùå Don't forget about performance requirements - 60 FPS and <100ms sync
- ‚ùå Don't ignore accessibility - plan for keyboard and screen reader support
