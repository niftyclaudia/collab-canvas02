  - [x] Update all examples to use "FIRST shape (most recently modified)" instead of "find most recent"
  - [x] Verify `updatedAt` is properly updated on manual shape modifications ✅ CONFIRMED

## Core Testing Tasks

### Functional Verification
- [ ] Verify `moveShape` works (by color, by type)
- [ ] Verify `resizeShape` works (rectangles, circles, with size helpers)
- [ ] Verify `rotateShape` works (all shape types)
- [ ] Verify `duplicateShape` works (correct offset)
- [ ] Verify `deleteShape` works (by identifier)
- [ ] Verify `getCanvasState` returns shapes correctly

## Context Awareness Testing

### Reference Resolution
- [x] Test "it"/"that" references work ✅ FIXED - Now uses most recently modified object
- [x] Test color identification works ("the blue one") ✅ WORKING
- [x] Test type identification works ("the circle") ✅ WORKING
- [x] Test most recent shape logic works when ambiguous ✅ FIXED - Now uses `updatedAt` ordering

## Test Command Verification

  - [x] Command: `testAI("create a blue rectangle at 500, 500")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("move the blue rectangle to the center")` ✅ PASSED
  - Expected: Rectangle moves to (2400, 2425) ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Expected output: "✓ Moved shape to new position" ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] Test 2: Resize rectangle
  - [x] Command: `testAI("make it twice as big")` ✅ PASSED
  - Expected: Rectangle becomes 400×300 (from 200×150) ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Expected output: "✓ Resized shape" ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] Test 3: Resize circle ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("create a red circle at 1000, 1000")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("make the circle bigger")` ✅ PASSED

  - [x] Command: `testAI("rotate it 45 degrees")` ✅ PASSED
  - Expected: Circle rotates 45 degrees ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Expected output: "✓ Rotated shape" ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Fix 1: Changed offsetX/offsetY from 0 to -displayWidth/2, -displayHeight/2 for proper center rotation
  - Fix 2: Updated system prompt to use RELATIVE rotation (add to current rotation) instead of absolute
  - Fix 3: Added rotation values to canvas state summary so AI can see current rotation ✅ WORKING! ✅ WORKED

<!-- - [ ] Test 5: Duplicate shape
  - Command: `testAI("duplicate the red circle")`
  - Expected: Copy appears with 20px offset
  - Expected output: "✓ Duplicated shape"

- [ ] Test 6: Delete shape
  - Command: `testAI("delete the blue rectangle")`
  - Expected: Blue rectangle disappears
  - Expected output: "✓ Deleted shape" -->

### Context Awareness Tests (Tests 7-9)
- [x] Test 7: "it" reference ✅ FIXED - Now works with most recently modified object
  - [x] Command: `testAI("create a green triangle at 1500, 1500")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("rotate it 90 degrees")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("duplicate it")` ✅ READY (duplicate function implemented)
  - Expected: Triangle rotates, then duplicates
  - Expected outputs: "✓ Rotated shape" → "✓ Duplicated shape"
  - Fix: Updated AI context tracking to use most recently modified object instead of most recently created

- [x] Test 8: Identify by color ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("create a yellow rectangle and a yellow circle")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("move the yellow rectangle to the top")` ✅ PASSED

  - Expected output: "✓ Moved shape to new position" ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] Test 9: Multiple operations in sequence ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("create a blue circle at 2000, 2000")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("make it smaller")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("move it to the bottom-right")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("rotate it 180 degrees")` ✅ PASSED
  - Expected: Circle shrinks → moves → rotates ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Expected outputs: 3 success messages ✅ ACHIEVED

### Error Handling Tests (Tests 10-11)
- [x] Test 10: Shape not found ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("move the purple hexagon to the left")` ✅ PASSED
  - Expected: AI responds that it can't find purple hexagon ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Expected: Should not crash ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Result: Returns success: false with clear error message "I couldn't find the requested shape on the canvas." ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] Test 11: Ambiguous reference with fallback ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("create 3 blue rectangles at random positions")` ✅ PASSED
  - [x] Command: `testAI("move the blue rectangle to the center")` ✅ PASSED
  - Expected: AI picks most recent blue rectangle ✅ ACHIEVED
  - Expected output: "✓ Moved shape to new position" ✅ ACHIEVED

## Recent Fix: AI Context Tracking Issue

### Problem Identified
- AI was using "most recently created" object instead of "most recently modified" object
- When user manually moved objects, AI still referenced the last created object, not the last moved object
- This caused "it" references to be incorrect in user's workflow

### Solution Implemented
- [x] **Database Query Fix**: Changed `getShapes()` and `subscribeToShapes()` to order by `updatedAt` instead of `createdAt`
- [x] **System Prompt Fix**: Updated AI prompt to explicitly state shapes are ordered by most recently modified first
- [x] **Visual Indicator**: Added "→ MOST RECENTLY MODIFIED:" indicator to first shape in canvas state
- [x] **Example Updates**: Changed all examples to use "FIRST shape (most recently modified)" instead of "find most recent"
- [x] **Verification**: Confirmed `updatedAt` timestamps are properly updated on manual modifications

### Expected Behavior Now
- When user manually moves an object, that object becomes the "most recently modified"
- AI commands like "move it to center" will now target the last object the user manually moved
- Context tracking now matches user expectations: "it" = last object I touched
