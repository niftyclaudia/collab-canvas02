# PR #4: Shapes ‚Äì Click-and-Drag Create + Sync (Firestore)

**Branch:** `feat/phase-4`  
**Goal:** Rectangle creation by drag with preview; real-time sync across users  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All requirements implemented and tested

---

## üìã Implementation Summary

This PR implements the complete shape creation and synchronization system as specified in task.md. Users can now create rectangles by clicking and dragging on the canvas, with real-time synchronization across all connected users via Firestore.

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### 4.1: Data Model ‚úÖ
- **Firestore Collection:** `canvases/main/shapes/{shapeId}`
- **Document Fields:**
  - `id`: Unique shape identifier
  - `type`: Shape type (currently 'rectangle')  
  - `x`, `y`: Position coordinates
  - `width`, `height`: Dimensions
  - `color`: Shape fill color
  - `createdBy`: User ID who created the shape
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Timestamps
  - `lockedBy`, `lockedAt`: Locking fields (for future PR #5)

#### 4.2: CanvasService Implementation ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/services/canvasService.ts`

**Core Methods:**
- `createShape(shapeData)`: Creates new shape in Firestore with auto-generated ID and timestamps
- `updateShape(shapeId, updates)`: Updates existing shape with new data  
- `subscribeToShapes(callback)`: Real-time subscription to shape changes
- `getShapes()`: One-time fetch of all shapes
- `validateShapeBounds()`: Ensures shapes stay within 5000√ó5000 canvas
- `normalizeRectangle()`: Handles negative drag directions properly

**Features:**
- Server timestamps for consistent ordering
- Proper error handling and logging
- Canvas bounds validation
- Automatic shape ID generation

#### 4.3: Canvas Drawing Logic ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`

**Drawing Flow:**
1. **mousedown** on background ‚Üí captures start point in canvas coordinates
2. **mousemove** ‚Üí updates preview rectangle with dashed border and 50% opacity
3. **mouseup** ‚Üí validates minimum size (10√ó10) and creates shape if valid
4. **Escape key** ‚Üí cancels current drawing operation

**Smart Interactions:**
- Only starts drawing on background clicks (not on existing shapes)
- Converts screen coordinates to canvas coordinates accounting for zoom/pan
- Prevents drawing outside 5000√ó5000 canvas bounds
- Mode-aware behavior (drawing only works in 'create' mode)
- Handles negative drag directions (e.g., dragging up-left from start point)

#### 4.4: Shape Rendering ‚úÖ
**Location:** `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx` + `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`

**Rendering Features:**
- Real-time Firestore subscription updates shapes automatically
- Each shape renders as Konva `<Rect>` with color from document
- Shapes persist across browser refresh
- Preview shape during drawing with dashed border and transparency
- Proper z-ordering (existing shapes below, preview on top)

### üé® User Experience Features

#### Mode Switching
**Location:** `src/components/Canvas/ColorToolbar.tsx`
- **Pan Mode (ü§ö):** Drag to move around canvas, no shape creation
- **Create Mode (‚úèÔ∏è):** Click and drag to create rectangles

#### Color Selection  
- 4-color palette: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow
- Visual feedback with checkmark on selected color
- Default selection: Blue (#3b82f6)
- New shapes use currently selected color

#### Visual Feedback
- **Drawing Preview:** Dashed border, 50% opacity, live size updates
- **Minimum Size:** Ignores rectangles smaller than 10√ó10 pixels  
- **Canvas Grid:** Subtle grid lines for visual reference
- **Canvas Bounds:** White background with gray border shows 5000√ó5000 area

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### State Management
**Context:** `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- Centralized shape state with real-time Firestore sync
- Drawing state management for preview functionality
- Mode and color selection state
- Loading states for better UX

#### Performance Optimizations
- Throttled drawing updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Canvas coordinate transformations cached during draw operations
- Automatic cleanup of subscriptions on unmount

#### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Firestore operations fail
- Validation of shape bounds and minimum sizes
- User feedback for invalid operations (logged to console)
- Authentication checks before shape operations
