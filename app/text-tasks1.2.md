# PR1.2 Implementation Tasks - Shape Delete & Duplicate Controls

**Feature:** Individual Shape Controls (Delete & Duplicate)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Time Taken:** ~2 hours  

---

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of individual shape controls (delete and duplicate buttons) that appear when a shape is locked by the current user. The backend service methods already existed - this implementation focused on the missing UI controls and fixing related issues.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Create ShapeControls Component
**File:** `app/src/components/Canvas/ShapeControls.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**What was done:**
- Created new React component for floating controls panel
- Added Delete button (🗑️) with red styling
- Added Duplicate button (📋) with blue styling
- Implemented proper positioning and styling
- Added TypeScript interfaces for props

**Key Features:**
- Only renders when `isVisible` is true
- Positioned absolutely above the locked shape
- Clean, modern button design with hover states
- Proper event handling for delete/duplicate actions

### 2. Integrate Controls Panel with Canvas
**File:** `app/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**What was done:**
- Added `controlsPanel` state management
- Integrated ShapeControls component into Canvas render
- Added event handlers for delete and duplicate operations
- Implemented controls panel positioning logic
- Added controls panel visibility management

**Key Features:**
- Controls appear when shape is locked
- Controls disappear when shape is unlocked
- Positioned dynamically above the locked shape
- Proper state management for panel visibility

### 3. Add Delete/Duplicate Event Handlers
**File:** `app/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**What was done:**
- Implemented `handleDeleteShape` function
- Implemented `handleDuplicateShape` function
- Added proper error handling with toast notifications
- Integrated with existing `canvasService` methods
- Added user authentication checks

**Key Features:**
- Calls `canvasService.deleteShape(shapeId)`
- Calls `canvasService.duplicateShape(shapeId, user.uid)`
- Shows success/error toast messages
- Hides controls panel after successful operations

### 4. Show Controls When Shape Locked
**File:** `app/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**What was done:**
- Modified `handleShapeClick` to show controls panel
- Added positioning calculation for controls panel
- Integrated with existing lock system
- Added controls panel hiding on unlock

**Key Features:**
- Controls appear immediately when shape is locked
- Positioned 50px above the shape center
- Handles different shape types (circle vs rectangle positioning)
- Automatically hides when shape is unlocked

### 5. Fix Canvas Bounds Handling in Duplicate
**File:** `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**Problem:** Duplicate operation failed when original shape was near canvas edge because 20px offset would go outside bounds.

**What was done:**
- Added bounds validation before creating duplicate
- Implemented fallback positioning to (50, 50) when offset would go outside bounds
- Added support for both circle and rectangle bounds checking
- Used existing `validateCircleBounds` and `validateShapeBounds` methods

**Key Features:**
- Duplicate appears 20px offset from original when possible
- Falls back to (50, 50) position when offset would go outside canvas
- Works for all shape types (rectangle, circle, triangle, text)
- Preserves all original shape properties

### 6. Fix Undefined Field Errors in Duplicate
**File:** `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**Problem:** Duplicate operation failed with "Unsupported field value: undefined" errors because non-text shapes had undefined text properties.

**What was done:**
- Removed all undefined fields from base duplicate data
- Added conditional logic to only include radius for circles
- Added conditional logic to only include text properties for text shapes
- Prevented Firestore from receiving undefined values

**Key Features:**
- Circles can be duplicated without text field errors
- Text shapes preserve all text formatting properties
- Rectangles and triangles work without unnecessary fields
- All shape types now support duplication

### 7. Fix Unlock Errors for Deleted Shapes
**Files:** `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`, `app/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`, `app/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**Problem:** Console errors when trying to unlock shapes that were already deleted, causing "No document to update" errors.

**What was done:**
- Added document existence check before unlock operation
- Implemented graceful handling of deleted shapes
- Added error message filtering to reduce console noise
- Improved error handling in multiple components

**Key Features:**
- No more "No document to update" errors in console
- Graceful handling of race conditions between delete and unlock
- Cleaner console output with only real errors logged
- Better performance by avoiding unnecessary Firestore calls

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios Completed

### ✅ Controls Panel Visibility
- [x] Lock a shape → controls panel appears above shape
- [x] Unlock shape → controls panel disappears  
- [x] Lock different shape → controls panel moves to new shape

### ✅ Delete Functionality
- [x] Lock a rectangle → click Delete → rectangle disappears
- [x] Lock a circle → click Delete → circle disappears  
- [x] Lock a triangle → click Delete → triangle disappears
- [x] Lock a text shape → click Delete → text disappears
- [x] Real-time sync works (deleted shape disappears instantly)

### ✅ Duplicate Functionality
- [x] Lock a rectangle → click Duplicate → second rectangle appears 20px offset
- [x] Lock a circle → click Duplicate → second circle appears 20px offset
- [x] Lock a triangle → click Duplicate → second triangle appears 20px offset
- [x] Lock a text shape → click Duplicate → second text appears with same content
- [x] Real-time sync works (duplicated shape appears instantly)

### ✅ Canvas Bounds Handling
- [x] Create shape near right edge → duplicate → new shape wraps to (50,50)
- [x] Create shape near bottom edge → duplicate → new shape wraps to (50,50)
- [x] No shapes created outside canvas bounds

### ✅ Error Handling
- [x] No more undefined field errors during duplication
- [x] No more unlock errors for deleted shapes
- [x] Proper error messages for real failures
- [x] Toast notifications for user feedback
