## ‚ú® Features

### üé® **Real-Time Collaboration**
- **Live Cursors**: See teammates' cursors with names and colors in real-time
- **Instant Sync**: Shape creation and modifications appear instantly across all users
- **Presence Awareness**: Know who's online and actively collaborating

### üîí **Smart Conflict Resolution**
- **First-Click Locking**: Elegant conflict prevention with visual feedback
- **Optimistic Updates**: Responsive interactions with background synchronization
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Locks release automatically on disconnect or completion

### ‚ö° **High Performance**
- **60 FPS Rendering**: Smooth interactions powered by Konva.js
- **<50ms Cursor Latency**: Real-time cursor updates at 20-30 FPS
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports 500+ shapes with 5+ concurrent users

### üéØ **Intuitive Design**
- **Click-and-Drag Creation**: Create rectangles with live preview
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate a large 5000√ó5000px canvas
- **Color Selection**: Professional toolbar with instant feedback

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Java 11+ (for Firebase Emulators)

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/niftyclaudia/collab-canvas02
cd collab-canvas02/app
npm install

# 2. Start Firebase Emulators (Terminal 1)
npm run emulate

# 3. Start Development Server (Terminal 2)
npm run dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:5173 in multiple browsers to test collaboration
```

**üéÆ Test Collaboration**: Open the app in multiple browser windows, sign up as different users, and watch real-time cursors and shape creation in action!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

CollabCanvas uses a hybrid Firebase architecture optimized for real-time collaboration:

```mermaid
graph TB
    Users([üë• Multiple Users]) --> UI[React + TypeScript UI]
    UI --> Services[Service Layer]
    Services --> RTDB[(Realtime DB<br/>Cursors & Presence)]
    Services --> Firestore[(Firestore<br/>Shapes & Users)]
    Services --> Auth[Firebase Auth]
    UI --> Konva[Konva.js Canvas]
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Hybrid Database**: RTDB for ephemeral data (cursors), Firestore for persistent data (shapes)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Clean separation between UI and Firebase operations
- **Individual Documents**: Shapes stored as separate Firestore documents for scalability
- **Optimistic Locking**: Visual feedback with background conflict resolution

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite | Modern, type-safe UI development |
| **Canvas** | Konva.js + react-konva | High-performance 2D canvas rendering |
| **Real-time** | Firebase Realtime Database | <50ms cursor and presence updates |
| **Persistence** | Firebase Firestore | Structured shape and user data |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth | Secure user management |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | Fast, global CDN deployment |
