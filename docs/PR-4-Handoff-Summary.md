## 🔧 Key Technical Details

### Layout Algorithm
```typescript
// Row Layout: Sort by x-position, calculate total width, distribute evenly
function calculateRowLayout(shapeIds: string[], shapes: Shape[], spacing: number = 20): PositionUpdate[]

// Even Spacing: Get bounding box, calculate available space, distribute shapes
function calculateEvenSpacing(shapeIds: string[], shapes: Shape[], direction: 'horizontal' | 'vertical'): PositionUpdate[]
```

### AI Tool Definitions
```typescript
// 6 new tools needed:
- groupShapes(shapeIds: string[], userId: string, name?: string): Promise<string>
- ungroupShapes(groupId: string): Promise<void>
- alignShapes(shapeIds: string[], alignment: string): Promise<void>
- arrangeShapesInRow(shapeIds: string[], spacing?: number): Promise<void>
- bringToFront(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
- sendToBack(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
```

### Performance Targets
- **Layout Commands:** <2s execution time
- **Real-time Sync:** <100ms latency  
- **Rendering:** 60 FPS during animations
- **Shape Capacity:** 50+ shapes supported

---

## ⚠️ Critical Dependencies

### Must Have Running
- [ ] React dev server (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured
- [ ] Production Firebase configured

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing AI service patterns in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Follow Canvas service patterns in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all new data structures
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications

---

## 🚨 Potential Blockers & Mitigations

### Blocker 1: OpenAI API Rate Limits
- **Mitigation:** Test with simple commands first, implement retry logic
- **Fallback:** Use mock responses for development testing

### Blocker 2: Layout Calculation Complexity  
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple equal spacing, iterate
- **Fallback:** Manual positioning if auto-spacing fails

### Blocker 3: Real-time Sync Conflicts
- **Mitigation:** Use batch updates, test with multiple users
- **Fallback:** Optimistic updates with conflict resolution

## 🚀 Ready to Begin!

**Next Steps for Builder Agent:**
1. **Read the complete PRD** (`docs/prd/PR-4-AI-Layout-Commands-PRD.md`)
2. **Follow the task list** (`docs/tasks/PR-4-AI-Layout-Commands-Tasks.md`)
3. **Start with Phase 1** (Service Layer Foundation)
4. **Test each phase** before moving to the next
5. **Verify all acceptance gates** before considering complete

**Remember:** This is a critical feature for rubric points. Focus on the core "arrange in a row" functionality first, then expand to the other 5 tools. Quality over speed!
