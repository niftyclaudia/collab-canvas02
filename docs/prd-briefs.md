## Notes for Agents

1. **Use the PRD Template**: Each PR should be developed using the template in `agent/prd-template.md`
2. **Focus on Required Features**: PRs #1-4 are essential for the complete feature set
3. **Real-time Sync**: All features must sync to other users in <100ms
4. **AI Integration**: AI features use the same CanvasService methods as manual features
5. **User Experience**: Prioritize features that enhance collaborative design workflows
6. **Testing**: Include comprehensive acceptance gates for each PR
7. **Performance**: Maintain 60 FPS with 500+ shapes and 5+ users

Each PR should be developed as a complete, testable feature that can be demonstrated independently while contributing to the overall system.
