## üéØ School Project Requirements

**Core (Must Have):**
- **Grouping** ‚Üê REQUIRED
- **Z-Index Management** ‚Üê REQUIRED  
- **AI Chat UI** (AI functionality) ‚Üê REQUIRED
- **AI Layout Commands** ("arrange in a row") ‚Üê REQUIRED
- Real-time collaboration (already working)
- Multi-select and shape manipulation (already working)

**Stretch Goals (If Time Permits):**
- Alignment Tools
- Comments System
- Advanced Keyboard Shortcuts
- Performance Optimization (500+ shapes)
- Complex AI Commands (login form, grids)

---

## ‚úÖ Decisions Made

2. **Focus:** Essential features only - skip nice-to-have for time management
3. **AI Chat:** Bottom drawer interface (not floating Clippy)
4. **Grouping:** Simple group/ungroup (no complex group transforms)
5. **Z-Index:** 4 buttons only (front/back, forward/backward)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

- **AI Layout Commands:** "Arrange in a row" algorithm complexity
- **Performance:** New features might impact existing performance

---

## üìä Database Schema

```typescript
// New: canvases/main/groups
{
  id: "group_abc",
  name: "Login Form",
  shapeIds: ["shape_123", "shape_456"],
  createdBy: "user_abc",
  createdAt: timestamp
}

// Updated: shapes collection
{
  // ... existing fields
  groupId: "group_abc" | null,  // NEW
  zIndex: 5,                    // NEW
}
```


---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

- **Time Management:** 72-hour estimate might be tight
- **AI Layout Commands:** "Arrange in a row" algorithm complexity
- **Performance:** New features might impact existing performance

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Service Layer Extensions

#### CanvasService Updates (Required)
```typescript
// Grouping operations
async groupShapes(shapeIds: string[], userId: string, name?: string): Promise<string>
async ungroupShapes(groupId: string): Promise<void>

// Z-index operations
async bringToFront(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
async sendToBack(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
async bringForward(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
async sendBackward(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
```

#### AIService Updates (Required)
```typescript
// Add missing tools to getToolDefinitions()
- groupShapes(shapeIds: string[], userId: string): Promise<string>
- ungroupShapes(groupId: string): Promise<void>
- alignShapes(shapeIds: string[], alignment: string): Promise<void>
- arrangeShapesInRow(shapeIds: string[], spacing: number): Promise<void>
- bringToFront(shapeId: string): Promise<void>
- sendToBack(shapeId: string): Promise<void>

// Update system prompt with layout examples
```

### UI Component Architecture (Required)

#### New Components
```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AIChat.tsx              // Main chat interface
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MessageHistory.tsx      // Message display
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatInput.tsx           // Input field
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Controls/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GroupingPanel.tsx       // Group/ungroup controls
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ZIndexPanel.tsx         // Layer controls
```

#### Enhanced Components
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Time Management** - 72-hour estimate might be tight
   - **Mitigation**: Start with highest-value features (grouping, AI layout)
   - **Fallback**: Cut nice-to-have features, focus on core

2. **AI Layout Command Complexity** - "Arrange in a row" algorithm
   - **Mitigation**: Simple sorting + spacing algorithm
   - **Fallback**: Manual spacing if auto-spacing fails

4. **Performance Impact** - New features might slow down app
   - **Mitigation**: Profile early, optimize as needed
   - **Fallback**: Reduce feature complexity if needed

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Must Pass (Critical)
- [ ] **Grouping** - Select 2+ shapes, group/ungroup functionality
- [ ] **Z-Index Management** - Bring to front/back, forward/backward
- [ ] **AI Chat UI** - Bottom drawer interface for AI commands
- [ ] **AI Layout Commands** - "Arrange these shapes in a row" works
- [ ] **Demo Video** - 3-5 minutes showing all features
- [ ] **Deployed to Production** - Working URL
- [ ] **Basic Testing** - 2+ users, real-time sync works

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review this PRD** - Confirm scope and priorities
2. **Start with Grouping** - Day 1
3. **Add Z-Index Management** - Day 2  
4. **Build AI Chat UI** - AI functionality - Day 3
5. **Implement Layout Commands** - "Arrange in a row" - Day 4
6. **Record Demo Video** - Day 5
7. **Test & Deploy** - Production readiness - Days 6-7

### üö´ NICE TO HAVE **
- ‚ùå Alignment Tools - Can skip
- ‚ùå Comments System - Can skip
- ‚ùå Advanced Shortcuts - Polish feature
- ‚ùå Performance Optimization - Scale bonus
- ‚ùå Complex AI Commands - Advanced features

**Ready to begin Phase 2 implementation**
