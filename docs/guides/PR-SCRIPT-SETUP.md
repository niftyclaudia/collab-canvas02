3. 🚀 Create the PR
4. 🔗 Give you the PR link

### Advanced: Git Alias (Optional)

Run once to set up:
```bash
./.github/pr-alias-setup.sh
```

Then use from anywhere:
```bash
git pr develop
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile page"
git add .
git commit -m "Add profile edit functionality"
git add .
git commit -m "Add tests for profile features"

# 3. Create PR (that's it!)
./pr develop
```

## What the PR Description Looks Like

## Support

Having issues? Check:
- [Troubleshooting section in pr-workflow.md](pr-workflow.md#troubleshooting)
- Make sure you're on a feature branch (not develop/main)
- Ensure you have commits that aren't in the target branch

## Tips

- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/user-auth` or `bugfix/login-error`
  - These auto-generate nice PR titles
- **Commit messages**: Write clear messages - they appear in the PR
- **Review before creating**: The script shows a preview and asks for confirmation
