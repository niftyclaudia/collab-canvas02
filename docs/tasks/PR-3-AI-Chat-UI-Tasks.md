## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies
- [ ] Firebase emulators running (`npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Existing AIService in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Canvas context and hooks in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: `AI service integration issues` → Mitigation: `Test with simple commands first, verify OpenAI API key`
- [ ] Blocker 2: `Real-time sync conflicts` → Mitigation: `Use existing Firestore subscription patterns`
- [ ] Blocker 3: `Chat UI performance` → Mitigation: `Optimize message rendering, use CSS transforms`

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing service layer patterns in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Follow React Context + hooks pattern in `app/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all chat data
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications
- [ ] Follow existing component structure in `app/src/components/`
- [ ] Use Firebase emulators for testing (not production Firebase)

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with Firebase emulators (run `npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Use multiple browser windows for multi-user testing
- [ ] Test AI commands with simple shapes first
- [ ] Verify real-time sync with network throttling
