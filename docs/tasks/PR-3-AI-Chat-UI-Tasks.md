### Phase 3: Real-time Sync (Collaboration)
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Implement chat state management
  - [ ] Context: Add chat state to `CanvasContext.tsx`

  - [ ] State: Messages, drawer open/closed, processing
  - [ ] **Gate**: Chat state persists during session

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Handle AI command execution
  - [ ] Integration: Connect to existing `AIService.executeCommand`
  - [ ] Processing: Show "⚡ AI is thinking..." indicator
  - [ ] Success: Show "✅ Success" message
  - [ ] Error: Show "❌ Error" with details
  - [ ] **Gate**: AI commands execute and show feedback

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Real-time sync of AI operations
  - [ ] Leverage: Existing Firestore subscriptions for shapes
  - [ ] Sync: AI-generated shapes appear to all users
  - [ ] Latency: <100ms sync to other users
  - [ ] **Gate**: Multi-user AI operations work

### Phase 4: Testing (Quality Assurance)
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Write AI chat integration tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/integration/ai-chat.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: Chat interface opens/closes
  - [ ] Test: Message sending and display
  - [ ] Test: AI command execution
  - [ ] **Gate**: All integration tests pass

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Write AI service unit tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/unit/services/aiService-chat.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: `sendMessage` method behavior
  - [ ] Test: Error handling for invalid commands
  - [ ] Test: Integration with existing AI tools
  - [ ] **Gate**: All service tests pass

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Write chat component unit tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/unit/components/AIChat.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Test: Component rendering

## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies
- [ ] Firebase emulators running (`npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Existing AIService in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Canvas context and hooks in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: `AI service integration issues` → Mitigation: `Test with simple commands first, verify OpenAI API key`
- [ ] Blocker 2: `Real-time sync conflicts` → Mitigation: `Use existing Firestore subscription patterns`
- [ ] Blocker 3: `Chat UI performance` → Mitigation: `Optimize message rendering, use CSS transforms`

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing service layer patterns in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Follow React Context + hooks pattern in `app/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all chat data
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications
- [ ] Follow existing component structure in `app/src/components/`
- [ ] Use Firebase emulators for testing (not production Firebase)

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with Firebase emulators (run `npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Use multiple browser windows for multi-user testing
- [ ] Test AI commands with simple shapes first
- [ ] Verify real-time sync with network throttling
