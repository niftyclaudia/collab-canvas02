### Phase 3: Real-time Sync (Collaboration)
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Ensure real-time sync for complex operations
  - [ ] Verify each step syncs to other users <100ms
  - [ ] Test with 2+ browser windows
  - [ ] **Gate**: All users see each step of complex operations

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Handle concurrent complex operations
  - [ ] Test multiple users running complex commands
  - [ ] Ensure no conflicts between operations
  - [ ] **Gate**: Concurrent complex operations work independently

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Multi-user testing
  - [ ] Test with 2+ browsers
  - [ ] Verify sync latency <100ms
  - [ ] Test concurrent operations
  - [ ] **Gate**: Multi-user functionality works

### Phase 4: Testing (Quality Assurance)
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Write integration tests for complex commands
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/integration/ai-complex-commands.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: "Create login form" command
  - [ ] Test: "Make 3x3 grid" command
  - [ ] Test: Error handling for failed steps
  - [ ] **Gate**: All integration tests pass

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Write service unit tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/unit/services/aiService-complex.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: `executeComplexCommand` method
  - [ ] Test: `createLoginForm` method
  - [ ] Test: `createGrid` method
  - [ ] Test: Error handling and rollback
  - [ ] **Gate**: All service tests pass

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Write UI component tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/unit/components/AIChat-complex.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: Progress indicators display correctly
  - [ ] Test: Error states show properly
  - [ ] Test: Success states show properly
  - [ ] **Gate**: All component tests pass

## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies
- [ ] React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Existing AI service patterns in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Canvas context and hooks in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`
- [ ] Production Firebase connection established

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: `AI service integration complexity` → Mitigation: `Start with simple commands, test incrementally`
- [ ] Blocker 2: `Real-time sync for multi-step operations` → Mitigation: `Test with multiple browser windows, verify each step`
- [ ] Blocker 3: `Performance with many shapes` → Mitigation: `Optimize rendering, batch operations`

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing AI service patterns in `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Follow React Context + hooks pattern in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all data
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications
- [ ] Add comments for complex logic
- [ ] Follow existing component structure in `app/src/components/AI/`
- [ ] Use production Firebase for testing

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with production Firebase connection
- [ ] Use multiple browser windows for multi-user testing
- [ ] Verify real-time sync with network throttling
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
