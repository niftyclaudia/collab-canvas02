## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies
- [ ] React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Production Firebase connection configured
- [ ] Existing CanvasService patterns in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
- [ ] Canvas context and hooks in `app/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: `Production Firebase connection issues` → Mitigation: `Check Firebase config, verify API keys`
- [ ] Blocker 2: `Real-time sync conflicts` → Mitigation: `Test with multiple browser windows, check Firestore rules`
- [ ] Blocker 3: `Z-index sorting performance` → Mitigation: `Use efficient sorting algorithm, test with 50+ shapes`

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing CanvasService patterns in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
- [ ] Follow React Context + hooks pattern in `app/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all data
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications
- [ ] Add comments for complex z-index logic
- [ ] Follow existing component structure in `app/src/components/Canvas/`
- [ ] Use production Firebase for testing

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with production Firebase
- [ ] Use multiple browser windows for multi-user testing
- [ ] Verify real-time sync with network throttling
- [ ] Test edge cases: invalid shape IDs, network errors, concurrent updates
