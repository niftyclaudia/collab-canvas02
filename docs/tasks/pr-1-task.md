## Implementation Tasks (For Builder Agent)

### Phase 1: Service Layer (Foundation)
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Add group methods to CanvasService
  - [ ] Method: `groupShapes(shapeIds: string[], userId: string, name?: string): Promise<string>` in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
  - [ ] Method: `ungroupShapes(groupId: string): Promise<void>` in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
  - [ ] Method: `moveGroup(groupId: string, deltaX: number, deltaY: number): Promise<void>` in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
  - [ ] Method: `deleteGroup(groupId: string): Promise<void>` in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
  - [ ] Method: `duplicateGroup(groupId: string, offsetX: number, offsetY: number): Promise<string[]>` in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
  - [ ] Error handling: Lock conflicts, invalid operations, network errors
  - [ ] Examples: Follow patterns in `canvasService.ts` for existing methods
  - [ ] **Gate**: All 5 methods exist and are testable

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Add Firestore data model
  - [ ] Collection: `canvases/main/groups`
  - [ ] Document structure: `{ id, name?, shapeIds: string[], createdBy: string, createdAt: Timestamp, updatedAt: Timestamp }`
  - [ ] Update Shape interface: Add `groupId: string | null` field
  - [ ] Update security rules in `app/firestore.rules`
  - [ ] **Gate**: Data model matches PRD requirements

- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Update security rules
  - [ ] Firestore rules: Update `app/firestore.rules` for groups collection
  - [ ] Add rules: Users can read/write groups they created, read all groups in canvas
  - [ ] **Gate**: Rules deployed and tested

### Phase 2: UI Components (Interface)
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Create GroupingPanel component
  - [ ] Component: `app/src/components/Canvas/GroupingPanel.tsx`
  - [ ] Props interface: `{ selectedShapes: Shape[], onGroup: () => void, onUngroup: () => void }`
  - [ ] State management: Use `useCanvas` hook for group state
  - [ ] Examples: Follow patterns in `Canvas/Canvas.tsx`, `Auth/Login.tsx`
  - [ ] **Gate**: Component renders without errors

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Add visual indicators for grouped shapes
  - [ ] Component: `app/src/components/Canvas/GroupVisualIndicator.tsx`
  - [ ] Visual: 3px dashed blue border around grouped shapes
  - [ ] Integration: Update `Canvas.tsx` to show indicators
  - [ ] **Gate**: Visual indicators show correctly

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Update Canvas component for group selection
  - [ ] File: `app/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
  - [ ] Add group selection logic: Click grouped shape selects entire group
  - [ ] Add group visual indicators rendering
  - [ ] **Gate**: Group selection works as expected

- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Integrate with CanvasContext
  - [ ] File: `app/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`
  - [ ] Add group state management: `selectedGroup`, `groupedShapes`
  - [ ] Add group operations: `groupShapes`, `ungroupShapes`, `moveGroup`
  - [ ] **Gate**: Service integration works end-to-end

### Phase 3: Real-time Sync (Collaboration)
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Implement Firestore subscriptions for groups
  - [ ] Subscription: `subscribeToGroups(canvasId: string, callback: (groups: Group[]) => void)`
  - [ ] Update handlers: Update local state when groups change
  - [ ] Cleanup: Proper unsubscribe in useEffect cleanup
  - [ ] **Gate**: Real-time updates work <100ms

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Handle concurrent group operations
  - [ ] Conflict resolution: Check locks before grouping, show toast on conflicts
  - [ ] Optimistic updates: Update UI immediately, rollback on error
  - [ ] Rollback handling: Revert UI state if operation fails
  - [ ] **Gate**: Concurrent edits don't corrupt state

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Multi-user testing
  - [ ] Test with 2+ browsers
  - [ ] Verify sync latency <100ms
  - [ ] Test concurrent group operations
  - [ ] **Gate**: Multi-user functionality works

### Phase 4: Testing (Quality Assurance)
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Write integration tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/integration/grouping.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: Basic group/ungroup functionality
  - [ ] Test: Firestore sync with groups collection
  - [ ] Test: Multi-user group scenarios
  - [ ] **Gate**: All integration tests pass

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Write service unit tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/unit/services/canvasService-grouping.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test: All 5 group service methods
  - [ ] Test: Error handling for lock conflicts
  - [ ] Test: Validation for invalid operations
  - [ ] **Gate**: All service tests pass

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Write component unit tests
  - [ ] File: `app/tests/unit/components/GroupingPanel.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Test: GroupingPanel component behavior
  - [ ] Test: Visual indicator component
  - [ ] **Gate**: All component tests pass

### Phase 5: Performance & Polish (Optimization)
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Add keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Cmd/Ctrl+G: Group selected shapes
  - [ ] Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+G: Ungroup selected group
  - [ ] Integration: Add to Canvas component key handlers
  - [ ] **Gate**: Keyboard shortcuts work correctly

- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Error handling and toast notifications
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages for lock conflicts
  - [ ] Success toast for group/ungroup operations
  - [ ] Graceful degradation for network errors
  - [ ] **Gate**: Error handling is robust

- [ ] **Task 5.3**: Accessibility
  - [ ] Screen reader support: Announce "Grouped" or "Ungrouped"
  - [ ] Focus management when group state changes
  - [ ] Keyboard navigation for group operations
  - [ ] **Gate**: Accessibility requirements met

- [ ] **Task 5.4**: Performance optimization
  - [ ] 60 FPS during group operations
  - [ ] Smooth rendering with 50+ shapes
  - [ ] Optimized re-renders for group updates
  - [ ] **Gate**: Performance targets met

## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies
- [ ] Firebase emulators running (`npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Existing service layer patterns in `app/src/services/`
- [ ] Canvas context and hooks in `app/src/contexts/` and `app/src/hooks/`

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Blocker 1: `Firebase emulator connection issues` → Mitigation: `Check emulator status, restart if needed`
- [ ] Blocker 2: `Real-time sync conflicts` → Mitigation: `Test with multiple browser windows, check Firestore rules`
- [ ] Blocker 3: `Group selection logic complexity` → Mitigation: `Start with simple click-to-select-group approach`

### Code Patterns to Follow
- [ ] Use existing service layer patterns in `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
- [ ] Follow React Context + hooks pattern in `app/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for Group and updated Shape types
- [ ] Include proper error handling with toast notifications via `ToastContext`
- [ ] Add comments for complex group selection logic
- [ ] Follow existing component structure in `app/src/components/Canvas/`
- [ ] Use Firebase emulators for testing (not production Firebase)

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with Firebase emulators (run `npm run emulate` from `app/` directory)
- [ ] Use multiple browser windows for multi-user testing
- [ ] Verify real-time sync with network throttling
- [ ] Test edge cases: lock conflicts, invalid selections, network errors
- [ ] Test group dissolution when <2 members remain
