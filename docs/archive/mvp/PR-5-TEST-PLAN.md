# PR #5: Simple Locking + Drag Move - Test Plan

## Feature Overview
First-click wins shape locking system with 5-second timeout, visual feedback for lock states, and drag-to-move functionality for locked shapes in CollabCanvas.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to click on a shape to lock it so I can move it without interference from other users
- As a user, I want to see when I have successfully locked a shape (green border) so I know I can edit it
- As a user, I want to see when another user has locked a shape (red border + lock icon) so I know not to try editing it
- As a user, I want to drag my locked shapes around the canvas so I can position them where needed
- As a user, I want my lock to automatically release when I'm done editing so others can use the shape
- As a user, I want to receive feedback when I try to interact with a locked shape so I understand why I can't edit it
- As a user, I want locks to timeout after reasonable inactivity so shapes don't get permanently stuck

## Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Firebase Emulators
cd app
firebase emulators:start

# Terminal 2 - React App  
cd app
npm run dev
```

**Verify Setup:**
- Emulator UI accessible at http://localhost:4000
- React app accessible at http://localhost:5173
- Authentication working (from PR #1)
- Canvas with pan/zoom working (from PR #2)  
- Shape creation working (from PR #4)
- At least 2-3 shapes already created on canvas for testing

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Core Locking Functionality
- [ ] Users can click shapes to acquire locks successfully
- [ ] First-click wins for simultaneous lock attempts (within reasonable race condition limits)
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly shows locked-by-me (green border) vs locked-by-other (red border + lock icon)
- [ ] Locks automatically release on deselect (click away)
- [ ] Locks automatically release after drag completion
- [ ] Locks automatically timeout after 5 seconds of inactivity
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for failed lock attempts with correct username

### ‚úÖ Shape Movement Requirements
- [ ] Locked shapes can be dragged smoothly around canvas
- [ ] Drag movement syncs to other users within <100ms
- [ ] Drag operations feel responsive with no lag
- [ ] Shape position persists correctly after drag completion
- [ ] Lock releases automatically after successful drag

### ‚úÖ Multi-User Sync Requirements
- [ ] Lock state changes sync between users within <100ms
- [ ] Visual lock indicators (borders, icons, opacity) update in real-time
- [ ] Lock conflicts prevented - only one user can lock shape at a time
- [ ] Lock release immediately makes shape available to other users
- [ ] No stuck locks after disconnect, refresh, or network issues

### ‚úÖ Visual Feedback Requirements
- [ ] Green border (3px) clearly indicates "locked by me"
- [ ] Red border (3px) + lock icon indicates "locked by other"
- [ ] 50% opacity for shapes locked by others
- [ ] Lock icon (üîí) visible and well-positioned
- [ ] Visual transitions are smooth without flicker or artifacts
- [ ] Lock indicators work with all shape colors and sizes

### ‚úÖ Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Toast notifications for lock conflicts: "Shape locked by [username]"
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of locks on disconnect/refresh
- [ ] Race condition handling (acceptable MVP limitation documented)
- [ ] Network interruption recovery
- [ ] No console errors during normal locking operations

### ‚úÖ Performance Requirements
- [ ] Lock/unlock operations complete within 100ms
- [ ] Canvas maintains 60 FPS during shape dragging
- [ ] Lock indicators move smoothly with pan/zoom operations
- [ ] No performance degradation with multiple locked shapes
- [ ] Multi-user locking doesn't impact cursor tracking performance

### ‚úÖ Integration Requirements
- [ ] Locking system works with existing authentication
- [ ] Lock state managed through CanvasService properly
- [ ] Integrates with existing shape creation and canvas context
- [ ] Presence system continues working during shape locking
- [ ] Canvas pan/zoom/color selection unaffected by locking

## Known Limitations

### Race Condition Window (~50ms)
- **Issue:** If two users click same shape within ~50ms, last-write-wins may cause wrong user to get lock
- **Impact:** Low probability with 2-5 users in typical usage
- **Mitigation:** Toast notification to losing user, can retry immediately
- **Future Fix:** Upgrade to Firestore transactions (post-MVP)

### Single Shape Selection
- **Issue:** Users can only lock one shape at a time (no multi-select)
- **Impact:** Cannot move multiple shapes simultaneously
- **Status:** By design for MVP simplicity

### Basic Lock Timeout
- **Issue:** 5-second timeout is client-side check, not server-enforced
- **Impact:** Slight inconsistency possible if client clocks differ
- **Status:** Acceptable for MVP, server-side timeout in post-MVP

### No Lock Persistence
- **Issue:** Locks don't survive browser refresh (by design)
- **Impact:** Refreshing releases all locks
- **Status:** Intentional to prevent stuck locks

## Integration Points for Next PRs

- **PR #6:** Security rules will validate lock operations and ensure proper user permissions
- **PR #6:** Tests will cover locking system thoroughly with automated test suite
- **PR #6:** Polish will improve visual feedback and error handling

## Next Steps After This PR

- **PR #6:** Rules, Testing, Polish - comprehensive security rules and automated tests for locking system
- Integration with future features (multi-select, advanced shape operations)
- Potential upgrade to Firestore transactions for race condition elimination

## Testing Notes

### Recommended Testing Order
1. **Single User Tests:** Verify basic locking mechanics work
2. **Multi-User Tests:** Test conflict prevention and sync
3. **Edge Cases:** Network issues, disconnect, rapid operations  
4. **Performance Tests:** Ensure 60 FPS and <100ms sync targets
5. **Integration Tests:** Verify compatibility with existing features

### Testing Tips
- Use browser dev tools to monitor network requests and performance
- Test with Firebase Emulator UI to observe Firestore document changes
- Use multiple browser types (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for compatibility
- Test on different network conditions (slow 3G simulation)
- Clear browser cache between test sessions to avoid state issues

### Bug Reporting Format
When reporting issues, include:
- Browser type and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior  
- Screenshots of visual issues
- Console errors (if any)
- Network conditions during test
