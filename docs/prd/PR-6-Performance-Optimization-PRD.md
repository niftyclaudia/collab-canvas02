## 1. Summary

Optimize CollabCanvas performance to maintain 60 FPS with 500+ shapes and 5+ concurrent users while ensuring all real-time sync operations complete in <100ms.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

- **User Problem**: Current system performance degrades with large canvases (500+ shapes) and multiple concurrent users, causing lag, stuttering, and poor user experience
- **Why Now**: Essential for production readiness and professional use cases with complex designs and team collaboration
- **Goals** (ordered, measurable):
  - [ ] G1 — Maintain 60 FPS consistently with 500+ shapes on canvas
  - [ ] G2 — Support 5+ concurrent users without performance degradation
  - [ ] G3 — Keep all real-time sync operations under 100ms latency
  - [ ] G4 — Optimize AI response times to meet <2s single-step, <5s multi-step targets

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- [ ] Not implementing shape virtualization (culling) - current approach sufficient for 500 shapes
- [ ] Not optimizing for 1000+ shapes - 500 is the target limit
- [ ] Not implementing advanced caching strategies - focus on core optimizations
- [ ] Not adding performance monitoring dashboards - manual testing sufficient

---

## 4. Success Metrics

- **User-visible**: Smooth 60 FPS interactions with 500+ shapes, no lag during drag/resize operations
- **System**: <100ms sync peer-to-peer, <2s AI single-step commands, <5s AI multi-step commands
- **Quality**: 0 performance regressions, all existing features maintain performance

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a **designer**, I want smooth interactions with large canvases so that I can create complex designs without lag
- As a **team member**, I want real-time collaboration to remain responsive with multiple users so that we can work together efficiently
- As a **power user**, I want AI commands to execute quickly even with many shapes so that I can use AI assistance effectively

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

- **Entry points and flows**: Performance optimizations are transparent to users - no UI changes required
- **Visual behavior**: No visual changes - optimizations are under-the-hood improvements
- **Loading/disabled/locked states**: No new states - existing loading states remain
- **Accessibility**: No accessibility changes - existing keyboard/screen reader support maintained
- **Performance**: 60 FPS during all interactions; cursor updates 20-30 FPS; network sync <100ms; AI commands <2s single, <5s multi-step

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

- **MUST**: Maintain 60 FPS with 500+ shapes during all interactions (drag, resize, rotate, select)
- **MUST**: Support 5+ concurrent users without performance degradation
- **MUST**: Keep real-time sync operations under 100ms latency
- **MUST**: Optimize marquee selection performance for large shape counts
- **SHOULD**: Optimize AI service response times to meet latency targets

- [Gate] All sync operations complete in <100ms across all users
- [Gate] AI commands execute within latency targets (<2s single, <5s multi-step)

---

## 8. Data Model

No new data model changes required. Optimizations focus on:

- **Existing Firestore collections**: `shapes`, `groups`, `comments` - no schema changes
- **Existing RTDB structure**: `cursors`, `presence` - no changes needed
- **Shape rendering optimization**: Efficient Konva.js rendering patterns
- **Subscription optimization**: Reduced Firestore listener overhead

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

**CanvasService optimizations:**
```typescript
// Existing methods remain unchanged - optimizations are internal
createShape(payload: CreateShapeInput): Promise<string>
updateShape(id: string, changes: Partial<Shape>): Promise<void>
deleteShape(id: string): Promise<void>
subscribeToShapes(canvasId: string, cb: (shapes: Shape[]) => void): Unsubscribe

// New performance monitoring methods
getPerformanceMetrics(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>
```

**CursorService optimizations:**
```typescript
// Existing methods with performance improvements
updateCursorPosition(position: CursorPosition): Promise<void>
subscribeToCursors(canvasId: string, cb: (cursors: Cursor[]) => void): Unsubscribe

// Throttling optimizations (internal)
private throttledCursorUpdate: (position: CursorPosition) => void
```

**AIService optimizations:**
```typescript
// Existing methods with response time optimizations
executeCommand(prompt: string, userId: string): Promise<AIResponse>

// New performance methods
getResponseTimeMetrics(): Promise<ResponseTimeMetrics>
```

- **Pre-conditions**: All existing service contracts maintained
- **Post-conditions**: Performance improvements without breaking existing functionality
- **Error handling**: Same error handling strategy with performance monitoring
