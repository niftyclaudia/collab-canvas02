# PRD: Complex AI Commands — End-to-End Delivery

**Feature**: Complex AI Commands

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Ready for Development

**Agent**: Alex (PM Agent)

**Target Release**: Phase 2 (Nice-to-Have)

**Links**: [Action Plan], [Test Plan], [Designs], [Tracking Issue], [Agent Tasks] (`docs/tasks/PR-5-Complex-AI-Commands-Tasks.md`)

**Note**: This PRD is created by the PM Agent (Alex) and handed off to the Builder Agent (Bob) for implementation.

---

## 1. Summary

Implement complex multi-step AI commands like "create login form" and "make 3x3 grid" that execute multiple shape creation and layout operations in sequence, providing users with powerful natural language interfaces for complex design tasks.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

- **User Problem**: Users need to create complex layouts (forms, grids, patterns) but manual creation is time-consuming and requires precise positioning
- **Why Now**: Essential for demonstrating advanced AI capabilities and completing the AI agent feature set for rubric scoring
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] G1 — "Create login form" command creates 6 properly positioned elements (2 labels, 2 inputs, 1 button, 1 title)
  - [ ] G2 — "Make 3x3 grid" command creates 9 squares in perfect grid formation
  - [ ] G3 — Multi-step operations complete successfully with clear success feedback
  - [ ] G4 — Error handling works for failed steps in complex operations

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- [ ] Not doing advanced pattern generation (ASCII art, repeating patterns) - defer to future phases
- [ ] Not doing image upload or complex media handling - text and shapes only
- [ ] Not doing undo/redo for multi-step operations - manual corrections only
- [ ] Not doing custom spacing algorithms beyond basic grid and form layouts

---

## 4. Success Metrics

- **User-visible**: Multi-step commands complete in <5s, 90%+ success rate on valid commands
- **System**: <100ms sync between steps, 60 FPS maintained during complex operations
- **Quality**: 0 blocking bugs, all acceptance gates pass, error handling graceful

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a **designer**, I want to say "create login form" so that I get a complete form layout instantly
- As a **collaborator**, I want to see complex AI operations in real-time so that I understand what's happening
- As a **user**, I want clear feedback when multi-step operations fail so that I can retry or adjust

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

- **Entry points**: AI Chat interface (bottom drawer) - same as existing AI commands
- **Visual behavior**: 
  - "⚡ AI is thinking..." during multi-step operations
  - Step-by-step progress indicators: "Creating form elements...", "Positioning inputs...", "Adding button..."
  - Success message: "✅ Login form created with 6 elements"
  - Error message: "❌ Failed to create form: [specific error]"
- **Loading/disabled states**: Chat input disabled during complex operations, clear progress feedback
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader announces progress steps, keyboard navigation maintained
- **Performance**: 60 FPS during operations, feedback <50ms, network sync <100ms

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

- **MUST**: Multi-step command execution with progress feedback
- **MUST**: Real-time sync of each step to other clients in <100ms
- **MUST**: Error handling with rollback for failed steps
- **SHOULD**: Optimistic UI updates where safe

**Acceptance gates embedded per requirement:**

- [Gate] When User A says "create login form" → 6 elements appear in proper layout, User B sees each step in real-time
- [Gate] When User A says "make 3x3 grid" → 9 squares appear in perfect grid, User B sees grid formation
- [Gate] Error case: If step 3 of 6 fails → clear error message, partial progress preserved, retry option available

---

## 8. Data Model

No new data model changes required. Uses existing shape creation and positioning through CanvasService methods.

**Existing Shape Model** (no changes):
```typescript
interface Shape {
  id: string;
  type: 'rectangle' | 'circle' | 'triangle' | 'text';
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  radius?: number;
  text?: string;
  fontSize?: number;
  fontWeight?: 'normal' | 'bold';
  fontStyle?: 'normal' | 'italic';
  textDecoration?: 'none' | 'underline';
  color: string;
  zIndex: number;
  groupId: string | null;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  lockedBy: string | null;
  lockedAt: Timestamp | null;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

**Validation rules**: Standard shape validation applies
**Indexing/queries**: Existing Firestore subscriptions handle real-time updates

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

**AIService method extensions** (add to existing aiService.ts):

```typescript
// Complex command execution
async executeComplexCommand(
  command: string, 
  userId: string, 
  context?: CanvasState
): Promise<ComplexCommandResult>

interface ComplexCommandResult {
  success: boolean;
  stepsCompleted: number;
  totalSteps: number;
  createdShapes: string[];
  errors: string[];
  message: string;
}

// Specific complex commands
async createLoginForm(userId: string, position?: {x: number, y: number}): Promise<ComplexCommandResult>
async createGrid(
  userId: string, 
  rows: number, 
  cols: number, 
  spacing: number,
  position?: {x: number, y: number}
): Promise<ComplexCommandResult>
```

**Pre-conditions**: User authenticated, valid command format
**Post-conditions**: All shapes created and positioned, real-time sync complete
**Error handling**: Rollback failed steps, preserve successful steps, clear error messages

---

## 10. UI Components to Create/Modify

- `src/components/AI/AIChat.tsx` — Add progress indicators for multi-step operations
- `src/components/AI/MessageBubble.tsx` — Add step-by-step progress display
- `src/services/aiService.ts` — Add complex command execution methods
- `src/utils/aiPrompts.ts` — Add complex command system prompts and examples

---

## 11. Integration Points

- Uses `AIService` for command execution
- Uses `CanvasService` for shape creation and positioning
- Real-time sync via existing Firestore subscriptions
- State managed through `CanvasContext`
- Authentication via `AuthContext`

---

## 12. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates

**Happy Path**
- [ ] "Create login form" creates 6 elements in proper layout
- [ ] "Make 3x3 grid" creates 9 squares in perfect grid
- [ ] Gate: User B sees each step in real-time <100ms

**Edge Cases**
- [ ] Invalid commands show clear error messages
- [ ] Partial failures preserve successful steps
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully

**Multi-User**
- [ ] Complex operations don't conflict with manual edits
- [ ] All users see progress indicators
- [ ] Concurrent complex commands work independently

**Performance**
- [ ] Multi-step operations complete in <5s
- [ ] 60 FPS maintained during complex operations
- [ ] Memory usage acceptable for 20+ shapes

---

## 13. Definition of Done (End-to-End)

- [ ] Complex command methods implemented and unit-tested
- [ ] Progress indicators work in AI chat interface
- [ ] Real-time sync verified across 2 browsers (<100ms)
- [ ] Error handling graceful with rollback
- [ ] Test Plan checkboxes all pass
- [ ] Multi-step operations complete successfully
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Complex operations timeout → **Mitigation**: Progress feedback, step-by-step execution
- **Risk**: Partial failures corrupt state → **Mitigation**: Rollback mechanism, preserve successful steps
- **Risk**: Performance impact with many shapes → **Mitigation**: Batch operations, optimize rendering

---

## 15. Rollout & Telemetry

- **Feature flag**: No (part of existing AI system)
- **Metrics**: Complex command usage, success rate, completion time
- **Manual validation**: Test with 2+ users, verify real-time sync
- **Firebase Analytics**: Track complex command usage and success rates

---

## 16. Open Questions

- **Q1**: Should we limit complex operations to prevent abuse? → **A**: Yes, max 20 shapes per operation
- **Q2**: How to handle user interruption of complex operations? → **A**: Allow cancellation, preserve completed steps

---

## 17. Appendix: Out-of-Scope Backlog

- [ ] Advanced pattern generation (ASCII art, repeating patterns)
- [ ] Custom spacing algorithms beyond basic layouts
- [ ] Undo/redo for multi-step operations
- [ ] Complex media handling (images, videos)

---

## Authoring Notes

- Write the Test Plan before coding; every sub-task needs a pass/fail gate.
- Favor a vertical slice that ships standalone; avoid partial features depending on later PRs.
- Keep contracts deterministic in the service layer; UI is a thin wrapper.
- Consider Firebase/Firestore limitations and optimize for real-time collaboration.
- Ensure TypeScript types are comprehensive for better development experience.
