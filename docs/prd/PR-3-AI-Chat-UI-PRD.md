# PRD: AI Chat UI — End-to-End Delivery

**Feature**: AI Chat Interface

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Ready for Development

**Agent**: Alex (PM Agent)

**Target Release**: Phase 2

**Links**: [Action Plan], [Test Plan], [Designs], [Tracking Issue], [Agent Tasks] (`docs/tasks/pr-3-task.md`)

**Note**: This PRD is created by the PM Agent (Alex) and handed off to the Builder Agent (Bob) for implementation.

## 1. Summary

Create a bottom drawer chat interface that allows users to interact with the AI agent using natural language commands, enabling collaborative design through conversational AI assistance.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

**User Problem**: Users need an intuitive way to control the canvas using natural language commands instead of manual UI interactions.

**Why Now**: This is a P0 required feature for Phase 2 that enables the core AI functionality needed for the collaborative design tool.

**Goals** (ordered, measurable):
- [ ] G1 — Users can open AI chat interface and send natural language commands
- [ ] G2 — AI processes commands and executes canvas operations in real-time
- [ ] G3 — All users see AI-generated shapes and operations synchronously

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- [ ] Not implementing voice input (text-only for MVP)
- [ ] Not implementing chat history persistence across sessions (session-only)
- [ ] Not implementing advanced AI features like image generation
- [ ] Not implementing chat export or sharing functionality

---

## 4. Success Metrics

- **User-visible**: Chat interface opens in <500ms, commands execute in <2s
- **System**: Real-time sync of AI operations to all users in <100ms
- **Quality**: 90%+ command success rate, all acceptance gates pass

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a **designer**, I want to type "create a blue rectangle" so that I can quickly add shapes without using manual tools
- As a **collaborator**, I want to see AI-generated shapes appear in real-time so that I can coordinate with my team
- As a **user**, I want clear feedback when AI is processing so that I know my command is being handled

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

**Entry Points and Flows**:
- Chat button in bottom-right corner of canvas
- Click to open bottom drawer (300px initial height)
- Resizable drawer with min/max height constraints
- Collapsible to 50px when minimized

**Visual Behavior**:
- Bottom drawer slides up from bottom of screen
- Message history scrolls automatically to latest message
- User messages: right-aligned, blue background
- AI messages: left-aligned, gray background
- Status indicators: "⚡ AI is thinking...", "✅ Success", "❌ Error"

**Loading/Disabled States**:
- Input disabled during AI processing
- Loading spinner in input field
- Clear visual feedback for all states

**Accessibility**:
- Keyboard navigation (Tab to focus, Enter to send)
- Screen reader support for message content
- Focus management when drawer opens/closes

**Performance**: 60 FPS during drawer animations, AI response <2s, sync <100ms

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

**MUST**: 
- Bottom drawer interface with message history
- Input field with send button
- Real-time message display
- Status indicators for processing/success/error
- Integration with existing AIService
- Real-time sync of AI operations to all users

**SHOULD**:
- Resizable drawer interface
- Collapsible/expandable functionality
- Message formatting for readability
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Acceptance Gates**:
- [Gate] User types "create a blue rectangle" → AI processes → blue rectangle appears on canvas
- [Gate] User B sees AI-generated rectangle in real-time (<100ms)
- [Gate] Error case: invalid command shows clear error message
- [Gate] Processing state shows "⚡ AI is thinking..." indicator

---

## 8. Data Model

No new Firestore collections needed. AI Chat UI uses existing:
- Canvas state (shapes collection)
- User authentication (users collection)
- Real-time presence (RTDB)

**Local State**:
```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  type: 'user' | 'ai';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  status?: 'processing' | 'success' | 'error';
}

interface ChatState {
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  isOpen: boolean;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  drawerHeight: number;
}
```

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

**AIService Integration**:
```typescript
// Existing AIService methods to leverage
executeCommand(prompt: string, userId: string): Promise<AIResponse>
getToolDefinitions(): ToolDefinition[]

// New chat-specific methods
sendMessage(content: string, userId: string): Promise<ChatMessage>
subscribeToMessages(callback: (messages: ChatMessage[]) => void): Unsubscribe
```

**CanvasService Integration**:
- Uses existing CanvasService methods for shape operations
- Real-time sync via existing Firestore subscriptions
- No new service methods required

**Pre-conditions**: User must be authenticated
**Post-conditions**: AI operations sync to all users via existing real-time infrastructure
**Error Handling**: Invalid commands show toast notifications, network errors retry automatically

---

## 10. UI Components to Create/Modify

**New Components**:
- `src/components/AI/AIChat.tsx` — Main chat interface container
- `src/components/AI/MessageHistory.tsx` — Message list with scroll
- `src/components/AI/ChatInput.tsx` — Input field with send button
- `src/components/AI/MessageBubble.tsx` — Individual message display

**Modified Components**:
- `src/components/Layout/AppShell.tsx` — Add chat button and drawer container
- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx` — Add chat state management
- `src/hooks/useAI.ts` — New hook for AI chat functionality

---

## 11. Integration Points

- **AIService**: Leverages existing AI service for command execution
- **CanvasService**: Uses existing canvas operations for shape manipulation
- **AuthContext**: Requires user authentication for AI commands
- **CanvasContext**: Manages chat state and message history
- **Real-time sync**: Uses existing Firestore subscriptions for live updates

---

## 12. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates

**Happy Path**:
- [ ] User opens chat, types "create blue rectangle", AI creates shape
- [ ] Gate: Shape appears on canvas in <2s
- [ ] Gate: Other users see shape in real-time (<100ms)

**Edge Cases**:
- [ ] Invalid commands show clear error messages
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully with retry
- [ ] Empty input prevented from sending

**Multi-User**:
- [ ] User A sends AI command → User B sees result in real-time
- [ ] Concurrent AI commands don't conflict
- [ ] All users see same AI-generated shapes

**Performance**:
- [ ] Chat interface opens in <500ms
- [ ] AI commands execute in <2s
- [ ] Real-time sync maintains <100ms latency
- [ ] 60 FPS maintained during drawer animations

---

## 13. Definition of Done (End-to-End)

- [ ] AIChat component implemented with all states
- [ ] MessageHistory component with scroll and formatting
- [ ] ChatInput component with send functionality
- [ ] Integration with existing AIService
- [ ] Real-time sync verified across 2 browsers (<100ms)
- [ ] Keyboard/Accessibility checks pass
- [ ] Test Plan checkboxes all pass
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: AI response latency >2s → **Mitigation**: Optimize prompts, implement timeout handling
- **Risk**: Real-time sync conflicts → **Mitigation**: Use existing proven sync infrastructure
- **Risk**: UI performance during animations → **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, optimize re-renders

---

## 15. Rollout & Telemetry

- **Feature flag**: No (core P0 feature)
- **Metrics**: Chat usage, command success rate, response latency
- **Manual validation**: Test with 2+ users, verify real-time sync
- **Firebase Analytics**: Track chat interactions and AI command usage

---

## 16. Open Questions

- **Q1**: Should chat history persist across browser sessions?
- **Q2**: What's the maximum number of messages to keep in history?

**Decisions**: 
- Chat history is session-only for MVP
- Keep last 50 messages in memory

---

## 17. Appendix: Out-of-Scope Backlog

- [ ] Voice input for AI commands
- [ ] Chat history persistence across sessions
- [ ] Advanced AI features (image generation, complex layouts)
- [ ] Chat export/sharing functionality
- [ ] AI command suggestions/autocomplete

---
