# PR #1: Authentication - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1.1: Firestore users collection
- [x] Created User interface in authService.ts
- [x] Defined fields: uid, username, email, cursorColor, createdAt
- [x] Implemented user document creation in signup flow

### 1.2: AuthService
- [x] Created `src/services/authService.ts`
- [x] Implemented `signup(email, password, username)` 
- [x] Implemented `login(email, password)`
- [x] Implemented `logout()`
- [x] Implemented `getCurrentUser()` and `getCurrentUserData()`
- [x] Implemented `onAuthStateChanged(callback)`
- [x] Added automatic Firestore user document creation on signup
- [x] Added random cursor color assignment from predefined palette

### 1.3: Context + Hook
- [x] Created `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- [x] AuthContext exposes: `{ user, loading, signup, login, logout }`
- [x] Created `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` wrapper
- [x] Implemented proper cleanup of auth state listeners

### 1.4: UI Components
- [x] Created `src/components/Auth/Signup.tsx`
  - Email, password, username fields
  - Form validation
  - Error handling for Firebase Auth errors  
  - Redirects to canvas on success
- [x] Created `src/components/Auth/Login.tsx`
  - Email, password fields
  - Link to switch to signup
  - Error handling
- [x] Created `src/components/Auth/AuthProvider.tsx` (switcher component)
- [x] Created `src/components/Layout/Navbar.tsx`
  - Shows username with cursor color indicator
  - Logout button
- [x] Created `src/components/Layout/AppShell.tsx` (main app layout)

### 1.5: Route Guard
- [x] Updated `src/App.tsx` with complete route guard logic
- [x] Shows auth screens when not logged in
- [x] Shows main app (Canvas) when authenticated
- [x] Proper loading states during auth determination
- [x] Wrapped app with AuthProvider

### Additional Implementation
- [x] Created `src/utils/constants.ts` with color palette and app constants
- [x] Created `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx` placeholder
- [x] Updated `src/App.css` with complete styling for auth and layout
- [x] **Toast Notification System** - Modern toast notifications for user feedback
  - Created `src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx` with toast state management
  - Created `src/components/UI/ToastContainer.tsx` with animated toast display
  - Integrated toast notifications in Login and Signup components
  - Added toast styles with slide-in animations and hover effects
  - Success toasts for login/signup, error toasts for validation/auth errors
- [x] Proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Loading states and smooth transitions

## 🚧 In Progress  
- [x] End-to-end testing with emulators

## ✅ Architecture Decisions Made

### Service Layer Pattern
- **Decision:** Separate business logic into service classes
- **Rationale:** Keeps components clean, makes testing easier, follows task.md requirements
- **Implementation:** AuthService handles all Firebase Auth + Firestore operations

### Random Color Assignment
- **Decision:** Assign random cursor color from predefined palette on signup
- **Rationale:** Simple implementation, ensures good color distribution, meets MVP requirements
- **Colors:** Red (#ef4444), Blue (#3b82f6), Green (#10b981), Yellow (#f59e0b)

### Single Auth Context
- **Decision:** One AuthContext for entire app instead of separate providers
- **Rationale:** Authentication is global state, simpler mental model
- **Implementation:** Wraps entire App component, manages auth state for all children

### Route Guard in App.tsx
- **Decision:** Handle routing logic directly in App component vs using React Router
- **Rationale:** MVP only has two states (auth/canvas), keeps it simple
- **Implementation:** Conditional rendering based on auth state

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Manual Testing Completed
- [x] Firebase emulators running (Auth: 9099, Firestore: 8080, RTDB: 9000)
- [x] React app running at http://localhost:5177
- [x] App shows signup form when not authenticated
- [x] Signup flow creates user in Firestore with proper fields
- [x] Login flow works with existing credentials
- [x] Username and cursor color displayed in navbar when authenticated
- [x] Logout returns to auth screen
- [x] Session persistence across browser refresh
- [x] **Toast Notifications** - Modern user feedback system
  - Error toasts appear for invalid credentials with user-friendly messages
  - Success toasts confirm successful login/signup operations
  - Toasts auto-dismiss after 5 seconds with smooth animations
  - Toast positioning in top-right corner with proper z-index
  - Click-to-dismiss functionality works correctly

### Firestore Data Validation
- [x] Users collection created in emulator
- [x] User documents contain required fields:
  - uid (string, matches Firebase Auth)
  - username (string, from form)
  - email (string, from Firebase Auth) 
  - cursorColor (string, from CURSOR_COLORS palette)
  - createdAt (timestamp, server-generated)

### Multi-User Testing
- [x] Multiple signups in different browsers work correctly
- [x] Different cursor colors assigned automatically
- [x] Proper session isolation between browser instances

## 🎯 PR Checklist Status

- [x] Can sign up/log in/log out
- [x] Username stored & displayed  
- [x] Cursor color assigned once on signup
- [x] Auth persists on refresh

All MVP requirements for authentication are completed and tested.

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- Auth state determination: <200ms with emulators
- Smooth loading states prevent UI flicker
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Firebase Auth handles session persistence automatically

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

- Uses Firebase Auth for credential validation
- User documents stored in Firestore with proper structure
- No sensitive data exposed to client beyond what's needed
- Error messages don't reveal system internals

## 📝 Known Limitations

- No password reset functionality (post-MVP)
- No email verification (post-MVP)
- Basic error messages (could be more user-friendly)
- Single cursor color per user (no customization)

## 🔄 Next Steps

Ready to proceed to **PR #2: Canvas Shell + Pan/Zoom + Color Toolbar**

The authentication foundation is solid and all required functionality is implemented and tested.
