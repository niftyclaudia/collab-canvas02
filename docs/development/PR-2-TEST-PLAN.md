# PR #2: Canvas Shell + Pan/Zoom + Color Toolbar - Test Plan

## Feature Overview
5000√ó5000 collaborative canvas with Konva-based pan/zoom functionality, 4-color toolbar, and responsive layout shell for CollabCanvas.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a large 5000√ó5000 canvas so I can work on collaborative drawings with plenty of space
- As a user, I want to pan around the canvas by dragging so I can navigate to different areas easily
- As a user, I want to zoom in/out with my mouse wheel so I can work at different detail levels
- As a user, I want zoom to center on my cursor position so zooming feels natural and predictable
- As a user, I want to select from 4 predefined colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) so I can choose drawing colors
- As a user, I want to see which color is currently selected so I know what color I'm working with
- As a user, I want smooth 60 FPS interactions so the canvas feels responsive and professional

## Integration Points for Next PRs
- PR #3: Cursor positions will need to be converted to/from canvas coordinates
- PR #3: Presence system will integrate with canvas layout  
- PR #4: Shape creation will use selected color from color toolbar
- PR #4: Shapes will render within the pan/zoom coordinate system

## Next Steps After This PR
- PR #3: Cursor Sync + Presence (RTDB) - will use canvas coordinate system
- Canvas context will provide selected color for shape creation
- Pan/zoom state will be foundation for all collaborative interactions
