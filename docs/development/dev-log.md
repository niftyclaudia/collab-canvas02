# CollabCanvas: AI Development Log

> Review documents attached for context

**Project**: Real-time Collaborative Canvas Application  
**Timeline**: MVP completed in ~24 hours  
**AI Tools**: Claude for planning/architecture, Cursor AI for implementation  
**Live Demo**: [https://collab-canvas02.vercel.app/]  
**Repository**: [https://github.com/niftyclaudia/collab-canvas02]

## 🚀 Overview

Bootcamp MVP assignment to build a real-time collaborative canvas with multi-user synchronization, cursor tracking, shape creation, and conflict prevention. Built production-ready tool with real-time cursors, drag-drop shapes, and optimistic locking in ~24 hours using AI-assisted development.

**Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite | Konva.js | Firebase (Auth, RTDB, Firestore) | Vercel

---

## 💥 Key Technical Challenges

**1. Firebase Architecture Decision**  
Used Claude to understand RTDB vs Firestore. Implemented hybrid: RTDB for high-frequency cursor updates (<50ms), Firestore for persistent shapes.

**2. Optimistic Drag-Drop**  
Waiting for Firebase lock confirmation made dragging sluggish. Fixed: Select immediately, lock in background, handle conflicts gracefully.

**3. Cursor Performance**  
Throttled updates to every 30ms instead of every mousemove. Added Firebase `onDisconnect()` for auto-cleanup.

## 🤖 My AI Workflow

### **Phase 1: Planning with Claude**
- Understanding Firebase RTDB vs Firestore
- Planning data structure and architecture patterns
- Creating PRD and technical documentation

**Example Prompt**:
```
"I need real-time cursors and persistent shapes. Review the doc attached, 
explain how I should structure this?"
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation with Cursor AI**
- Attached PRD, task list, and architecture docs to context
- Prompted: "Build [feature] according to attached architecture"
- Always asked Cursor to explain its reasoning first

**Key Pattern**: "Based on architecture.md, implement [feature]" kept AI aligned with my decisions.

### **Phase 3: Documentation-Driven Development**
Created structured PR documentation for each major feature to maintain development velocity and quality:

**For each PR, I created 3 key documents:**
- **Summary** (`PR-X-SUMMARY.md`) - Technical implementation details, architecture decisions, files created/modified
- **Quick Start** (`PR-X-QUICK-START.md`) - 90-second validation test for rapid feature verification
- **Test Plan** (`PR-X-TEST-PLAN.md`) - Comprehensive testing scenarios with edge cases and validation steps

**Example Pattern**:
```
PR #1: Authentication
├── PR-1-SUMMARY.md (architecture decisions, security model)
├── PR-1-QUICK-START.md (signup → canvas → logout test)  
└── PR-1-TEST-PLAN.md (multi-user, error handling, performance)
```

**Benefits Discovered:**
- **AI Context**: Attached previous PR docs to keep AI aware of existing patterns
- **Quality Gate**: Quick Start prevented broken features from accumulating
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Detailed summaries made architecture decisions searchable
- **Testing Rigor**: Test plans caught edge cases I would have missed manually

## 💡 Tips for Coding with AI

### **What Worked**
1. **Plan First, Code Second** - Spent time with Claude understanding the problem before implementation
2. **Document for AI Context** - PRD + architecture docs = better AI output than vague prompts
3. **Structured PR Documentation** - Created Summary/Quick Start/Test Plan for each feature to maintain quality and AI context
4. **Be Specific with Prompts** - Include error messages, data structures, and desired outcomes
5. **Reference Your Docs** - Always point AI to specific documents and sections
6. **Test in Production Early** - Deployed day 2, caught latency issues that didn't show locally

### **What I Learned**
- AI excels at implementation when you understand the architectural "why"
- Documentation quality directly impacts AI code quality
- Manual testing still critical for real-time collaboration features
- Starting fresh with clear context beats long debugging sessions
- Explicitly state what NOT to do to prevent over-engineering

## 📊 Data Architecture

**Firestore (Persistent)**
```
canvases/{canvasId} → createdAt, createdBy, title
shapes/{shapeId} → canvasId, type, color, position, size, lockedBy
```

**RTDB (Ephemeral)**
```
cursors/{canvasId}/{userId} → x, y, timestamp
presence/{canvasId}/{userId} → online, lastSeen
```

---

## 🏆 Results

**Features Built** ✅
- Real-time cursor tracking (<50ms latency)
- Collaborative shape creation with live preview
- Drag-and-drop positioning with optimistic locking
- User presence indicators
- Clean authentication flow

**Performance**: 60 FPS rendering | 5+ concurrent users | 100+ shapes

**Stats**: ~2,800 lines of code | 47+ commits | 24 hours
