**PM Agent:** Alex  
**Builder Agent:** Bob  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

## 🎯 What We're Building

**Complex AI Commands** - Multi-step AI operations that create complex layouts like "create login form" and "make 3x3 grid" with real-time progress feedback and error handling.

### Key Features
- **"Create login form"** → Creates 6 properly positioned elements (title, 2 labels, 2 inputs, 1 button)
- **"Make 3x3 grid"** → Creates 9 squares in perfect grid formation
- **Progress indicators** → Step-by-step feedback during multi-step operations
- **Error handling** → Rollback failed steps, preserve successful ones
- **Real-time sync** → All users see each step as it happens

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Service Methods (AIService)
```typescript
// Main complex command executor
async executeComplexCommand(
  command: string, 
  userId: string, 
  context?: CanvasState
): Promise<ComplexCommandResult>

// Specific complex commands
async createLoginForm(userId: string, position?: {x: number, y: number}): Promise<ComplexCommandResult>
async createGrid(
  userId: string, 
  rows: number, 
  cols: number, 
  spacing: number,
  position?: {x: number, y: number}
): Promise<ComplexCommandResult>
```

### UI Components to Enhance
- `app/src/components/AI/AIChat.tsx` → Add progress indicators
- `app/src/components/AI/MessageBubble.tsx` → Add step-by-step display
- `app/src/components/AI/ChatInput.tsx` → Add loading states

### Files to Create/Modify
- `app/src/services/aiService.ts` → Add complex command methods
- `app/src/utils/aiPrompts.ts` → Add complex command examples
- `app/tests/integration/ai-complex-commands.test.ts` → Integration tests
- `app/tests/unit/services/aiService-complex.test.ts` → Service tests

## ✅ Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Features
1. **"Create login form"** creates 6 elements in proper layout
2. **"Make 3x3 grid"** creates 9 squares in perfect grid
3. **Progress indicators** show each step to all users
4. **Error handling** with rollback for failed steps
5. **Real-time sync** <100ms for each step

### Performance Targets
- Multi-step operations complete in <5s
- 60 FPS maintained during complex operations
- <100ms sync between users for each step
- Works with 20+ shapes without performance issues

### Quality Gates
- All tests pass (integration + unit + component)
- No console errors
- TypeScript types correct
- Code follows existing patterns
- Multi-user functionality verified

---

## 🚨 Critical Dependencies

### Existing Infrastructure (Already Working)
- ✅ AI Service with 9 tools (creation, manipulation, state)
- ✅ Canvas Service with shape CRUD operations
- ✅ Real-time sync via Firestore subscriptions
- ✅ AI Chat interface (bottom drawer)
- ✅ Authentication and user management

### What You Need to Add
- 🔧 Complex command execution methods
- 🔧 Progress indicators in AI chat
- 🔧 Step-by-step feedback display
- 🔧 Error handling with rollback
- 🔧 Integration tests

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
1. **Production Firebase** - Test with live Firebase connection
2. **Multi-browser testing** - Chrome + Chrome Incognito + Firefox
3. **Real-time verification** - Test with 2+ users simultaneously
4. **Performance testing** - Verify 60 FPS with 20+ shapes

### Test Scenarios
- **Happy Path**: "Create login form" → 6 elements appear correctly
- **Happy Path**: "Make 3x3 grid" → 9 squares in perfect grid
- **Error Handling**: Partial failure → rollback, preserve successful steps
- **Multi-User**: User A runs complex command → User B sees each step
- **Performance**: Complex operations complete in <5s

## 🎯 Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Service Layer (Foundation) - 1.5 hours
1. Add `executeComplexCommand` method to AIService
2. Add `createLoginForm` and `createGrid` methods
3. Update system prompts with complex command examples

### Phase 2: UI Components (Interface) - 1.5 hours
1. Enhance AIChat with progress indicators
2. Update MessageBubble for step display
3. Add loading states to ChatInput

### Phase 3: Real-time Sync (Collaboration) - 1 hour
1. Test multi-user complex operations
2. Verify <100ms sync for each step
3. Test concurrent operations

### Phase 4: Testing (Quality) - 1 hour
1. Write integration tests
2. Write service unit tests
3. Write component tests

### Phase 5: Performance & Polish - 0.5 hours
1. Performance optimization
2. Error handling refinement
3. Accessibility improvements

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Production Firebase connection established
- React dev server running (`npm run dev` from `app/` directory)
- Existing AI service working (test with simple commands first)

### First Steps
1. **Read the PRD** - `docs/prd/PR-5-Complex-AI-Commands-PRD.md`
2. **Review the task list** - `docs/tasks/PR-5-Complex-AI-Commands-Tasks.md`
3. **Start with Phase 1** - Service layer methods
4. **Test incrementally** - Each method before moving to UI

### Success Criteria
- [ ] "Create login form" works end-to-end
- [ ] "Make 3x3 grid" works end-to-end
- [ ] Progress indicators show to all users
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Multi-user functionality verified

---

## 📞 Support & Questions

### If You Get Stuck
1. **Check existing AI service patterns** - `app/src/services/aiService.ts`
2. **Review Canvas service methods** - `app/src/services/canvasService.ts`
3. **Test with production Firebase** - Live Firebase connection
4. **Use multiple browser windows** - For multi-user testing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't skip error handling - Complex operations can fail
- ❌ Don't forget real-time sync - Each step must sync to all users
- ❌ Don't ignore performance - 20+ shapes can impact rendering
- ❌ Don't skip testing - Multi-step operations need thorough testing
